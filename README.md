My name is Mertkan Ã–zlÃ¼, a 20-year-old software developer. I studied Information Technology in high school, where I learned C#, HTML, and CSS. Afterward, I interned for six months, receiving training in Oracle SQL, WordPress, HTML, and CSS.

I then earned two certifications: Microsoft Official Course: Developing ASP.NET MVC 6 Web Applications and the Certificate of Achievement. During this time, I focused on:

SOLID Principles
Entity Framework Core
Dependency Injection
Web API
.NET Core
ASP.NET MVC
I have developed various projects, including a logistics website, a brand website, and my personal website. I also have GitHub projects like a blog site and travel sites.

I briefly worked at a software company, gaining JavaScript experience, followed by seven months as a Junior Software Developer at another company, where I worked with Oracle SQL, RPA, Power BI, VMware, Plesk, and WordPress.

I am continuously improving my software development skills and aim to deepen my expertise further.

Skills: C# / ASP NET CORE / SQL / HTML / CSS / RPA / JS
